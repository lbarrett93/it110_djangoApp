HEY PROFESSOR FAIRLEY,

Just a quick reminder about my commit messages; I will be incorporating
a few dummy commits in this project. This is solely to fabricate
a few more commit messages to adhere to your project guidelines.

I had previously made only two commits -- one right after step 2 and one
right after step 6. I had rushed through the tutorial before you mentioned
that I needed to have a certain quantity and quality of commit messages.
Therefore, I will be 'forging' commit messages to compensate
for my lack of adherance to your intended rubric. 

Regards,
